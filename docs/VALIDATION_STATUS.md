## What Is Implemented

### Infrastructure (inherited from platform template)
- KFP v2 pipeline scaffold with all 8 stages wired
- MLflow run-per-stage tracking
- `purge_kfp_mlflow.py`
- Nsight Operator integration — add `kubernetes.add_pod_label(task, "nvidia-nsight-profile", "enabled")` to profile any stage
- BF16 direct loading with `max_memory={0: "100GiB"}` (Blackwell GB10 unified memory)

### Project-specific
- `config.yaml` — to be configured
- `formatters.py` / `loaders.py` — to be implemented per `WORKBOOK.md`
- `notebook.ipynb` — stage bodies to be filled in

---

## What Is Still Pending

- Configure `config.yaml`
- Implement dataset formatters and loaders
- Implement all pipeline stage bodies
- First pipeline run — establish baseline accuracy

---

## Known Issues

None yet.

> **Platform-level fixes** (bitsandbytes on Blackwell, trl 0.29 API, PIP_CONSTRAINT, nsys mmap, CUPTI privileges) are already incorporated in this template. See [qwen25-7b-arc-ft-eval-pipeline/docs/VALIDATION_STATUS.md](https://github.com/miramar-labs-org/qwen25-7b-arc-ft-eval-pipeline/blob/main/docs/VALIDATION_STATUS.md) for the full fix history (first green run).

## Latest Nsight Finding
